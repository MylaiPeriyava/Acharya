<b><div style="background-color:LemonChiffon">This Acharya was the son of one Deva Mishra who was the minister to the Kashmir King. This Deva Mishra had become infatuated with the Jaina religion and hence rejected all Vaidika Anushthana's. But his son even as a child was an illuminated soul and advised the father to embrace the Vedic tradition. (Hence the appellation Bala Guru.) Seeing the child reject the Jaina religion, the Jains influence the father to give up his son and throw Him into the Sindhu. But the Sindhu River Goddess bore the divine child on lotus leaves without harm. Further downstream, a native of Pushpapura by name Bhurivasu was observing vows to obtain a child and had at the time entered the river for bath. The river took the child to him and a formless voice was heard: "Pleased by your penance, I give this son unto you". Bhurivasu took the child joyfully, brought him up as his own son, and performed His upanayana. Being enlightened at birth, immediately after upanayana the youth set about teaching people the Vaidika dharma and Advaita. Upon meeting with Shri Ujjvala Shankara during the latter's tour around the country, at the age of seventeen He took to sannyasa. By instructions of His Guru He took a golden palanquin and a varied entourage along with Him (probably courtesy of the kings who were most impressed with the Guru as well). He arranging for the daily maintenance of one thousand Vedic scholars (who probably had suffered from the anti-Vedic troubles that had been raging through the nation at the time of His Guru which His Guru set right). He travelled to all parts of Bharata (from his native Kashmir) until all the sea coasts, and ensured that the work done by His Guru in eradicating anti-Vedic tendencies was not subverted. On the academic/philosophical side He also ensured the continuity of the Advaita tradition by teaching the Shankara Bhashya's forty-eight times. All this He did in a short period of eight years. After establishing His disciple Shri Surendra Saraswati on the Peetham, He entered a cave which was known as Samadhi Sthali at Tryambakeshvara near Nasikapuri, and was seen no more. His appellation of "Gauda" Sadashiva probably results from (or itself indicates) that the other later (53rd) Acharya by name Sadashivendra Saraswati was from Dakshina Bharata. Hence this Acharya originating in one of the Pancha Gauda desha's constituting Uttara Bharata was called "Gauda" Sadashiva. </div></b>

	The one who was born to a brahmin Śrīdeva Miśrā; soon after the birth uttered the Truth that 'everything is Ātman' due to the samskāras of the previous birth; the Buddhists and Jains unable to counter the doctrine threw him in the river Sindhu, who saved his life by placing him lovingly on the lotus petals.<br>
Being carried by her (river Sindhu) he (Sadāśivabāla) was given to a brahmin endowed with austerities saying "pleased by your austerities/penance today this boy/child is given"; then being asked/enquired by Bhūrivasu of Pushpapura and initiated by him - the saviour - father, he held high the school of non-dualism.<br>
