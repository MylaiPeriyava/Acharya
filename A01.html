<b><div style="background-color:LemonChiffon">This Acharya was the originator of an extraordinary establishment in the form of the Shankaracharya Acharya Peetham's, notably the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, which has played the leading role in the preservation of the Sanatana Dharma through the millennia. It is undoubtably His efforts and upadesha that has shown to us the original thoughts and way of life of the Rishis. At the early age of 5 His upanayana was performed by His father Shivaguru who taught Him the Veda. After the untimely demise of Shivaguru, He was sent by His mother to gurukula where He studied the Shastras in a very short time. He had returned home and for some time was performing service to His widowed mother. Taking as excuse a crocodile capturing His feet when He had gone for bath in the river, He obtained permission from His mother for taking to sannyasa. Reaching the Ashrama of Shri Govinda Bhagavatpada on the banks of the Narmada, He obtained proper procedural sannyasa and was received the traditional Advaitic interpretation of the Veda from His guru. By orders of His guru He left for Kashi where Lord Vishvanatha took the guise of a Chandala to bless Him. He then composed His famed bhashya's and toured the land teaching Advaita, the true interpretation of the Veda/Vedanta. He subdued or eradicated 72 different misinterpretations or distortions of the pristine Vedic tradition. Notably he won over the great Mimamsaka scholar Kumarila Bhatta (who was in his final days of life), and then over his student, Mandana Mishra, whom He made disciple by the name of Sureshvara. After having darshana of His paramaguru Shri Gaudapadacharya at Badarikashrama, He took a divine form and went to Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Obtaining the five sphatika linga's, He returned to earth. One day in Kashi, Vyasa Himself in the form of an elderly Brahmana came and examined Shri Shankara's scholarship and correct understanding of His Brahma Sutra's. Most pleased with the Acharya, He obtained from Lord Brahma an extension of life for Shri Shankara (which was intended to be only 16 years) so that He may further work to protect the tradition. His mother, back in Kerala, was about to breathe her final breath and mentally called out to Shri Shankara. By His Yogic powers, He immediately reached His mother's side, and performed her final rites. After this, He returned to His tour of upadesha. At the confluence of the Tunga and Bhadra rivers, He established the Sharada Peetham and stayed there for some years. He then undertook a kshetra yatra by which He came to Kanchipuram. Subduing the fierce aspect of the Devi Kamakshi there by establishing a Shrichakra, He ascended the Sarvajna Peetham which was governed by an invisible manifestation of Devi Sharada (Saraswati). By establishing His primary Acharya Peetham there, He appointed as His successor a young but illuminated soul by name Sarvajnatmendra Saraswati, under the care of His senior disciple Shri Sureshvara. The parampara of this Sarvajnatman continues even to this day as the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham. He instructed His disciples to reach the various parts of the country and ensure the protection of Sanatana Dharma and Advaita. For the common man, who cannot directly understand or experience philosophical truths, He showed the path of Shanmata, wherein six principal forms of God (as representative of the very many existing in our tradition) are worshipped without bias against other forms, as in the end all these are but manifestations of the single Paramatman. Having thus ensured the preservation of Sanatana Dharma and Advaita for posterity, He took a luminous form and merged into the Infinite at the sanctum sanctorum of Devi Kamakshi. </div></b>
