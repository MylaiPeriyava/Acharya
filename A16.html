<b><div style="background-color:LemonChiffon">Even in His childhood this Acharya had studied all four Veda's with their Anga's (auxiliary studies). After Samavartana (completion of Brahmacharya Ashrama) He took up Naishtika Brahmacharya (a vow of lifelong celibacy). On a Kshetra Yatra towards the Rama Setu, He was sought as preceptor in Sahitya (literature) by the then Trivandrum (Syananduram) King Kulashekhara Varma. After honouring the King's request in a short while, He completed and returned from His Kshetra Yatra. He was performing tapas at Mahendragiri (in today's Orissa) when Shri Gishpati Gangadhara came across Him and found Him qualified to be the next Pithadhipati. Thereby He gave sannyasa to Him at Vanchishvara and instructed Him to travel Bharata and reinstate Sanatana Dharma and Advaita to its glory. The country was filled with two kinds of intellectuals at that time: those who believed they had the real understanding of the Veda, and those who were against the Vaidika Dharma. Other groups of foreign origin following avaidika practices were also causing severe hindrance to those in the Vaidika dharma by refusing to peacefully co-exist with the prevalent society. Shri Ujjvala Shankara found the overall situation to be serious and took up serious measures. By His scholarship, He won over all those intellectuals in the tradition but with an imperfect understanding of it. [He showed them that as our Dharma is Sanatana (for all time), individual interpretations and ideas should not conflict with the age-old path shown by our forefathers the Rishi's.] By this time the various kings of the land had taken recognition of the great work being done by Shri Ujjvala Shankara. Their dedication to the dharma came to the forefront and they declared that all those who do not abide by the Vaidika Dharma or at least stop their hindrance to it shall leave the nation. This way, those self-styled scholars who were against the Vaidika Dharma and all those peoples of external origin who were damaging the fabric of the Vaidika society, all of who refused to listen to the peaceful arguments and guidance of Shri Ujjvala Shankara were delegated to move out of the land occupied by those in the Dharma. Thus the Acharya ensured that the Varnashrama Dharma's were re-established firmly. It is due to such drastic steps that the Acharya was forced to take that He earned the epithet of "Ujjvala" (fiery). But since He was universally recognized as a great soul with nothing but everyone's good at heart, He was called Mahayati (much as the 68th Acharya of recent times was called Mahaswami, and respected even by those of other religions). Due to this, when the Acharya finally attained in Kashmir at the place called Kalapura, it came to be known as Ujjvala Mahayati Pura. </div></b>
